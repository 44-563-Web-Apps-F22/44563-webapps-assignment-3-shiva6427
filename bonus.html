<u><b>Fun Facts:</b></u>
<ol>
    <li>Vultures have incredibly powerful bills that allow them to open carcasses.  If they can’t open a carcass, they won’t mind waiting for other predators to open it. That’s why they can often be seen eating together with eagles, coyotes, or hyenas.</li>
    <li>Old World and New World species are not actually related. But they do share biological traits and functions. Actually, vultures are more related to storks than to other birds of prey.</li>
    <li>Their feet and legs are weak, making them unable to carry away their prey. To feed their young, vultures regurgitate food.</li>
    <li>A vulture can eat over 1 kg of meat per minute.</li>
    <li>New World vultures do not have a syrinx. This means they can only growl and hiss.</li>
